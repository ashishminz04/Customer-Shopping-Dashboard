Customer Behavior Analysis

This project analyzes customer behavior to identify patterns and insights that can improve business decision-making. The workflow includes data loading, exploration, database integration, and dashboard visualization.

Steps

Data Loading:
The customer dataset is loaded into Python using pandas for preprocessing and cleaning. Missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent data are handled.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Key statistics and visualizations are generated to understand customer demographics, purchasing habits, and product preferences. Libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn are used.

Database Integration:
The cleaned dataset is imported into a MySQL database. SQL queries are written to extract insights such as top customers, most purchased products, and sales trends.

Insights and Queries:
SQL queries identify factors influencing customer retention, purchase frequency, and revenue growth.

Interactive Dashboard:
An interactive dashboard is created using Power BI to visualize key metrics and trends. It helps stakeholders monitor performance and make data-driven decisions.

Tools Used

Python, Pandas, MySQL, Power BI
